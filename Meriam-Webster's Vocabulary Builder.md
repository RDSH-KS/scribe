# Merriam-Webster's Vocabulary Builder
Second Edition, by Mary Wood Conrnog
## Introcuction to the Second Edition
*Merriam-Webster's Vocabular Builder * is designed to achieve two goals: (1) to add a large number of words to your permanent working vocabulary, and (2) to teach the most useful of the classical word-building roots to help you continue expanding your vocabulary in the future.
To achieve these goals, *Merriam-Webster's Vocabulary Builder* employs an original approach that takes into account how people learn and remember. Some vocabulary builders simply present their words in alphaabetical order; some provide little or no discussion of the words and how to use them; and a few even fail to show the kinds of sentences in which the words usually appear. But memorizing a series of random and unrelated things can be difficult and time -consuming. The fact is that we tend to remmember words easily and naturally when they appear in some meaningful context, when they've been shown to be useful and therefore worth remrembering. and when they've been properly explained to us. Knowing precisely how to use a word is just as important as knowing what it means.
Greek and Latin have been the sources of most of the words in the English language (the third principal source being the family of Germanic languages). All these words were added to the language long after the fall of the Roman empire, and more continue to be added to this day, with most new words-expecially those in the sciences-still making use of Greek and Latin roots. A knowledge of Greek and Latin roots will not only help you remember the meanings of the words in this book but will help you guess at the meanings of new words that you run into elsewhere. Remember what a root means and you'll have at least a fighting chance of  understanding a word in which it appears.
The roots in this book are only a fraction of those that exist, but they include almost all the roots that have produced the largest number of common English words. All these roots (somtiomes called stems) formed parts of Greek and Latin words. Some are shown in more than one form (for example, CRAC/CRAT), which means that they changed form in the original language, just as *buy* and *bought* are forms of the same English word.
Each of the more than 250 roots in this book is followed by four words based on the root. Each group of eight words (two roots) is followed by two quizzes. Every fifth group of words is a special eight-word seciton which may contain words based on classical mythology or history, words borrowed directly from Greek or Latin, or other special categories of terms. Each set of 40 words makes up a unit. Thus, the 30 units int the book discuss in detail a totlal of 1,200 words. In addition, the brief paragraphs discussing each word mastering a single word (for example, *compel*) can increase your vocabulary by several words (in this case, *compelling, compulsion*, and *compulsive*).
The words presented here aren't all ont he same level of difficulty - some are quite simple and some are truly challenging - but the great majority are words that could be encountered on the SAT and similar standardized tests.

Even the words you feel familiar with may only have a place in your recognition vocabulary - that is, the words you recognize when you see or hear them but don't actually use in your own speech and writing.
Each main word is followed by its most common pronunciation. Any pronunciation symbols unfamiliar to you can be learned easily by referring to the Pronunciation Symbols table on page vii.
The definition comes nex. We've tried to provide only the most common senses or meanings of eadch word, in simple and straightforward language, and no more than two definitions of andy word are given. (A more complete range of definitions can be found in a college dictionary such as *Merriam-Webster's college Dictionary*。)
An example sentence marked with a bullet (*) follows the definition. This sentence by itself can indicate a great deal about the word, including the kind of sentence in which it ofter appears. It can also serve as a memory adi; when you meet the word in the future, you may recall the example sentence more easily than the definition.
An explanatory paragraaph rounds out each entry. It may tell you what esle you need to know in order to use the word intelligently and correctly, when the definition and exapmle sententce aren't enought. It may tell you more about the word's roots and its history. It may discuss additional meanings or provide additional example sentences. It may demonstrate the use of closely related words. And it may provide an informative or entertaining glimpse into a subject related to the word. The intertionis to make you as comfortable as possible with each word in turn and to enable you to start using it immediately, without fear of embarrassment.
